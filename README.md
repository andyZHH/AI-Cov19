## Background

In the context of the pandemic, people often need to read COVID-19-related data from different media websites. The exact information released by the official platform is often ignored because of the lack of rich content.

For this reason, we are committed to developing an open source and free mobile application. It directly quotes the officially developed data interface to provide users with intuitive and concentrated data information and news.


## Install

This project uses [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/). A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a phone or emulator is required in the development phase of this project. Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

Requires React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to start. If you have installed one of these tools, you can directly start and run React Native. If they are not installed, it should take about an hour to install and configure them.

```sh
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

## Usage
